# Coffee Time
## Coffee-based microeconomies for hackers.

### Let me buy you a coffe.
An app for managing coffee debt within your office. Buy your buddy a coffee, and keep track of just how many coffee's that freeloader owes you. Debt is simplified across your group, creating a web of coffee credit. Pick up the tab at lunch and know your investing in the most stable commodity future available today - coffee.

### For everyone in your circle.
We know you have a GitHub account, so you allready have a Coffee Time account. Just authorize one of your groups as a Coffee Group, and your scheme to becoming the Coffee Baron is off the ground.

What it do:
Keeps a record of the number of coffee's you have bought for others within your group, or how many coffee's they have bought for you. Tracks and manages coffee debt.

How it do:
Uses your Github Teams to manage coffee groups. Once a Github Team is attached to Coffeetime.io, that Team's members can log into the app with their github account and buy each other coffee.
